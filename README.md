# traffic-lights
Traffic light junction powered by Arduino Uno and programmed via Arduino IDE.
This is my first project on Github. This project is a traffic light junction made with 6 LED's( 2 red, 2 yellow, and 2 green).
I will be adding updates to this project. 
The code is in the code.txt file, and the sketch is in the Arduino_Dual_Traffic_light.png file.
